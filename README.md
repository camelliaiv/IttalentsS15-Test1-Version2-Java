# Ittalents, Test 1, Version 2, Java
Task №1: Write a program that reads two int values separated by space – each one – the value of a dice. Possible inputs are from 1 to 6. The inputs are infinite. The pro- gram must stop when there have been 5 consecutive throws of a pair. Finally, the pro- gram must ouput the total number of throws as well as the number of sequences of throws that had a pair but did not end the program (were more than 2 but less than 5).

Task №2: Write a function that takes a varible that holds some text. The function must print the longest and shortest words in the text. Also the function must print the most common symbol in the text as well as the number of times it had been met.

Task №3: Write a method that by a given int number and another int x returns if the number has exactly x dividers (one and self excluded). Use Recursion!

Task №4: Write a method that finds whether there is path between two given cells in 2D labyrinth. The method takes 5 parameters – the coordinates of the two cells and the labyrinth itself. The labyrinth has walls marked with symbol 'W', that you cannot pass through. The other cells are marked with ' '. The method must return true or false de- pending on whether there is a path between start and end cells.
